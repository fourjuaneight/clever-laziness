Hi, I'm Juan and I like websites. Most of my time is spent making them for strangers online. I work as a Senior Full-Stack Developer over at [Big Pixel](https://thebigpixel.net). When I'm not working, I'm usually still coding. There's always something to automate.

Links are over on the left if you want to reach out.

If you're interested in what I'm currently messing around with, take a look at my pinned repos underneath.
