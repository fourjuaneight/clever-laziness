# Clever Laziness
The amount of work I'm able to accomplish on any given day is directly dependent on how much effort I have to put into it. Obviously, I can't get very far in life being that lazy, so a while ago I started to come up with clever ways to get a lot done with the minimal amount of effort. This blog chronicles my attempt to get things done, lazily.

## Creation
* Coded on macOS using [Atom](https://atom.io)
* Maintained on iPad using [Coda for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/coda/id500906297?mt=8), [Textastic](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/textastic-code-editor-6/id1049254261?mt=8) and [Working Copy](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/working-copy-powerful-git-client/id896694807?mt=8)
* Written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) on [Bear](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bear/id1016366447?mt=8) and/or [Ulysses](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ulysses-the-ultimate-writing-app/id950335311?mt=8) on iOS

### Made with Hugo
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io) is a static HTML and CSS website generator written in Go. It is optimized for speed, easy use and configurability. Hugo takes a directory with content and templates and renders them into a full HTML website. Hugo relies on [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) files with front matter for meta data.

### Look
Although Hugo has a plethora of community made [the is hosted on Github. I also used [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) as my CDN and [Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) for encryption.
