After leaving my day job, I decided to take a month and focus on myself. I later found out how short-sited it was and the issues this would bring. Any semblance of a structure I had before was gone. Although completing tasks has never been an issue for me, I do lack the motivation to get started. So after several Google searches, I determined to apply some aspects of GTD which best served my needs and use [Todoist](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/todoist-todo-list-for-organizing-work-and-errands/id572688855?mt=8) to organize my life. For those of you unfamiliar with GTD, the framework boils down to 5 simple steps:

* Capture: all ideas stored and written down.
* Clarify: sort items by priority, time, and urgency.
* Organize: group similar items together, tags accordingly.
* Reflect: periodically review tasks as to update and plan ahead.
* Engage: get shit done.

According to [David Allen](http://gettingthingsdone.com), the goal is to “capture everything that has your attention […] all your to-do’s, projects, things to handle or finish” as to let your brain focus on doing and not so much on the details.

## The Right Workflow for Me
Todoist has a very simple UI that streamlines adding tasks with natural language; perfect for dumping everything in quickly. Adding a little GTD flair to it, I came up with a process that has worked efficiently for me for some time now. Let’s break it down.

* **Inbox:**
I primarily use this as a mind dump. Any goals I wish to achieve today are thrown in here to be organized afterward.

* **Priority:**
What I’ve done is assign a level of importance to all four levels of priority. Each loosely based on the Eisenhower Matrix, combined with the 2nd step of GTD.

    1. Actionable = Important
    2. Timed = Urgent/Important
    3. Flexible = Not Urgent/Important
    4. Not Urgent/Not Important

If a task can be done promptly, then it's marked as actionable. Any time sensitive tasks are labeled "timed" with a reminder. The last two are self-explanatory.

*  **Labels:**
These become useful when searching for similar items spread across different projects, which we’ll talk about next. I use generic names that apply to any task.

    * call
    * email
    * shop
    * online
    * wife
    * review

* **Projects:**
Tasks are moved from Inbox to their respective projects. You can create sub-projects as well for more granular distribution.

    * Home
        * Family
        * Chores
    * Wellness
        * Exercise
        * Medical
    * Work
        * Clever Laziness
        * Freelancing
    * Education
        * Python
        * Swift
    * Development

* **Today:**
As the name indicates, here you can view currently due and past due items. Throughout the day, check back to make sure you’re on top of things and everything is being taken care of as it’s completed.

* **Next 7 days:**
You can view a week ahead and plan accordingly. By the end of the day, if some items were not completed, make sure to review and reschedule all of them.

### Putting a Task Together
Todoist uses natural language to quickly create tasks without having to scroll through menus.

`Publish Todoist blog post today at 2:30 pm !!1 @online #Clever Laziness`

The app will automatically recognize certain symbols and highlight each piece of information and add it to your task accordingly. The task that we added above told the app to publish a blog post today at 3:30 pm with a 1 priority, labeled as *online* and organized in the *Clever Laziness* project. Simple.

## Challenges
Putting together a system like this can be done quickly once you know how to take advantage of the app. Hence the blog post. Customizing Todoist to where you want isn't hard. What I did was write down how I wanted to organize my information and placed it accordingly on the various areas of the app. You’re welcome to use this post as a reference and go from there to save you some time.

Over time I’ve been able to pick up on patterns and behaviors that tell me why I’m more likely to not complete a task as opposed to others. There are goals you can set and stats that will give you a general idea what your shortcomings are and where you’re excel. These have been particularly helpful for me as there different levels you can achieve.

I don’t expect everyone that reads this to master Todoist in a day and conquer productivity. The idea to put this together came weeks before the execution; much laziness occurred in between. But I’m confident with this post as a reference I’ll help you get there a little easier.

FYI - Todoist is a free service and but there is a paid tire which is fairly inexpensive with monthly and yearly plans. Many of the features mentions here are part of the Premium plan, which I pay for.
