My setup is fragmented. I have a love/hate relationship with Google services. On one hand, they provided seamless integration with all their services which is a big part of what everyone already uses. But unless I have a paid business account, I’m the product and I’m not comfortable with that. I use Chrome for development and Safari for personal use. The former has fantastic developer tools, but the latter works seamlessly between iOS and macOS. It’s worth mentioning that the new App Store removes the wishlist, which I use heavily. 

My bookmarks are all over the place and I have a hard time keeping anything I bookmark synced between services and devices. There are a few bookmarking and bookmark syncing services out there, but they are either overpriced or just bad. But then there’s [Trello](https://trello.com). I use it heavily for work and it’s a web app so that means it’s available anywhere. The third party integration is robust and I have to save practically all media types to a card. So why not use that as a bookmarking database?

I’d like to have a versatile solution where I don’t have to leave Trello to see what I’m looking for. Let me explain. Normally I’d open a Board, look through a List, open a Card, and then click on a link. Which is not all that different than just saving links to Apple Notes. Although I do like the rich text view in Notes with the website title and a preview thumbnail. Let’s do that.

Loosely based on a [Club MacStories](https://club.macstories.net) [Workflow](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/workflow/id915249334?mt=8), I made several of my own where the URL is taken, expanded, and embedded in the site title; the title is also taken from the expanded URL. The article image taken be optionally taken and used as a thumbnail for the card. I made a few of these that slightly different depending on what I’m saving and where.

I’ve broken down my workflow to various chunks as it allows me to reuse Workflows across others. Trello uses the Safari view controller so it's easy to stay in the app. The rich card with an image and title lets you browse naturally. I’ve also included tags for text-only bookmarks for easier classification. Search is quite robust as well so optionally I can just start typing in the search bar and get instant results.

On iOS, Spotlight allows for search within Trello which comes in handy often. Overall I’m fairly pleased with the setup but will later tweak the workflows. At the time of writing this, I’m running iOS 11b9 and Workflow seem fairly stable. Although the future of the app is still uncertain since acquired by Apple. Fingers crossed they don’t kill it.

I’ve also created a workflow which prompts me to choose the board, list, and card. It then grabs the link embedded in the description of the cars and opens the URL in Safari. I can pull this up from the share sheet in the bottom without leaving the browser. It’s quite handy.
