I’m not sure how I got to where I am now. Don’t get me wrong, I’m quite happy with how things turned out. But the more I think about it, the more things seem just accidental. Let me elaborate.

I left my IT job as I felt I was no longer challenge and wanted a change. For some time I was interested in iOS development and decided to give Swift a try. The plan was to study while working full-time, slowly move into part-time and dedicate more time to learning until I could find a job in iOS. Sound like a great plan, right? Well, it was, except my impatience got the best of me and I resigned a few weeks after coming up with that plan.

The wife was certainly not happy about this. But in a way, this forced me to decide whether to go back into IT or pursue development full-time. I decided on the latter and got to work. It was painful at first; it'd been some time since I left school. Still, I managed to push through and get into a routine.

So I’m learning Swift, making my first app and all is good so far. A few months back I had begun writing every day as a way to clear my head and self-reflect on myself. With that in mind, I figured I should probably document my coding journey as it would bring the same benefits while helping me make an online presence with a blog.  Although there were plenty of options for starting an online blog, I figured I should probably make one for myself if I wanted to see more legitimate as a developer[^1].

## Sidetrack
After a few days of reading up on static-site generators, I decided to give that a try. I figured I could just host my code on GitHub and have a CDN distribute it cheaply. Although Jekyll was prominent everywhere I looked, Hugo caught my attention. I had no I idea what the hell I was doing so I figured having a great community would be great, so that’s what sold me. In case you hadn’t noticed, I’d just completely taken a detour to learn a new tech on a field that wasn’t my interest to make I blog which I believe would legitimize myself as a developer. Better than sidetracking on Twitter Netflix, I guess.

So I “learned” HTML and CSS, tortured myself with JavaScript, and even picked up some Go along the way[^2]. Eventually, I build the site, wrote a few blog post, got some mediocre traffic, and that was that. I go back to Swift and quickly realize that it was not as fun. I’d had such a great time with front-end and I was not enjoying myself at all with Swift. There’s nothing wrong with iOS development, I just happened to like web more. And if I wasn’t enjoying myself, then what was the point?

Of course, discarding several months of learning a language I was never going to use went as well as expected with the wife. But since she's a better person than me, she supported me anyway.

## Working
After my short-lived blog went online, I had learned enough that I thought I could give working a try. Of course, no one was going to hire me without any sort of experience, so I thought freelancing would be a good starting point. It took me weeks to get the courage to make a profile on UpWork, but eventually, I did and I got my first job offer in the first 24 hours.

Within the first few weeks of working, I learned far more than I did in months of studying. Although the fear of working as a developer wasn’t completely gone, I did feel immensely more confident than before. So I decided to keep at it, increasing my hourly rate and learning how to improve my presentation and proposals with new clients. It’s been 4 months since I started freelancing and I can say this is the best decision I could’ve ever made. I’m earning more than I did in IT, I work from my home[^3], spend more time with my wife and set my own rules. There are some caveats like insurance and managing your own taxes, but I can honestly say the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.

## I Love The Web
Looking for a change I went into development. Wanting to build something for my own led me down a different path than expected. Curiosity kept me going deeper, which eventually led to a career in a field I had never imagined at a time I didn’t plan. Life did great by me for a change and I'm glad to be here.

The web is a wonderful place built by millions of people over many years and often I wonder how the hell it’s still running. There are so many strong opinions on what is the best way to do things and everyone loves to just throw a new framework at problems instead of fixing them. But hey, I still love this thing. I grew up online. By the time I could understand what a computer was, I was “surfing the net” and stumbling into wired corners of the internet. I met my wife online and have made some of the best friendships there as well. I have a job because I was able to learn the skills I have online and am able to work online with people all around the world. The web has done a lot for me, so I do my part in making it a better place for everyone.

If there's anything you can take away from this is to ignore your fears and just go for it. There's only so much reading and doing practice code challenges can do for you. Pick up a project that will challenge you. Work on things you aren't all that familiar with. Collaborate with other developers. The more engaged you are in coding, the better.
