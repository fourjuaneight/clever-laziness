Space operas are a dime a dozen. But very few manage to capture my attention like Three Body did. There's a lot to be said about the heavy reliability on complex science. But I want to focus on something that particularly fascinated me. It's often that the invading species is far more advanced than ours and seemingly managed to overcome the great challenges of any civilization with ease. The usually are these almost perfect beings that because of their superiority, are able to travel the stars and wish to control all other life. That's not the case here. The invading race is plagued with tragedy and because of it, they are able to advance to the point they have; they have to, otherwise, they'll cease to exist. It's the same reason they choose to invade earth. Our reaction as humans to learning about the existence of life outside our planet felt very natural to me. Whenever we encounter some beyond our understanding, we either feel the need to destroy it or worship it. In this case it's the later. For some at least. But was struck me the most is that in this case, we are the threat to the over species. A legitimate one. There's a lot to unpack and I don't want to give away the whole plot. But if you're looking for a different point of view on alien invasion -a more realistic one- this book is for you.
