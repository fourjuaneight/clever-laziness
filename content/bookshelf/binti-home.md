I came from a family which their whole existence revolved around their beliefs and the community within them. Tradition was everything. I have long since foregone that way of life. So I strongly relate with Binti's experience coming back home just to be met with heavy criticism and the overwhelming guilt that comes with. I understand culture. I understand deep-rooted traditions. So with Home, I felt everything; the anger, the guilt, the confusion. And things hit even deeper towards the end when Binti realizes how one's prejudice can easily blind even the smartest among us. Home does an amazing job at pulling you in deep into Binti's mind and world.
