Night Masquerade was a great conclusion to the series. In a way, it brought a close to many of the questions I had but still managed to keep things mysterious. You see, the thing with Binti is that it's weird. Binti herself grapples with identity issues and acceptance in a very familiar way, but she's having new DNA and body parts introduced into her body. It feels relatable although not really. And that's what I enjoyed the most about the whole series. It's a space drama in a unique way. The story felt intriguing and I loved it.
