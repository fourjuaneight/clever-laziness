At some point, I decided my opinion was worth sharing with the world. I’d recently quit my exciting IT job, so I didn’t want to spend much on another subscription just to have a blog. With a little digging, I learned you could make a static website with static-site generators, host the code on GitHub, and have a CDN distribute it from there. There were several options on how to go about this, but ultimately I settled on Hugo for my project.

Hugo really caught my interest because the community and developers were quite active on their forums. They were quick to tell me how to Google stuff or pointed me right back to the docs where I came from. On occasions, the less senior devs would grace us with their knowledge and expand on questions and concerns anyone had. The docs are always being worked on, and they even changed the url slugs so all the older links in the forums would break!

They were using Netlify as the CDN for the Hugo website. Netlify has wonderful features, amazing docs and for some crazy reason, it’s mostly free. So I embarked on the long journey of learning HTML, CSS, JS and some Go to later discovered there was no need to learn the latter. I build my first Hugo site in a few seconds and was blown away by the speed. Probably because I had tried Jekyll before and anything seems faster than that.

I had a great time making my blog that I just kept on learning and creating. So much so that I completely forgot I had originally left my IT job to pursue iOS development and not got down this path. Eventually, I needed money for food and rent, so I thought maybe I could do some freelancing work as a front-end developer while I transition back to learning Swift. I read this Medium post titled “How to Make $50 an Hour Working From Home” and was instantly hooked by the clickbait. They mentioned UpWork and thought I would give it a try. I was terrified but mostly excited. I got my first job offer within 24hrs. After that, I kept on getting more and more job offers. I kept on raising my hourly rates and gained so much experience.

Fast forward a year later and I’m now working full time as an indie front-end developer. Probably because there’s seemingly no one else on UpWork working with Hugo, but I like to think I’m just talented. 

## Recent Work
Anyways, here are some of the recent projects I’ve worked on. This site is also built with Hugo, hosted on GitHub, distributed with Netlify, and the code is also nicer. If you’d like to learn how to make your own website as well with Hugo, don’t ask me. There are plenty of resources out there.
