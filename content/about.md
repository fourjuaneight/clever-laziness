The end of civilization will come, not by climate change or nuclear war, but by millions of connected microwaves and coffee makers becoming sentient at once! So while we wait for that day, let's leverage the power of the web and machines to make them work for us.

## Why "Clever Laziness"?
The amount of work I'm able to accomplish on any given day is directly dependent on how much effort I have to put into it. Obviously, I can't get very far in life being that lazy, so a while ago I started to come up with clever ways to get a lot done with the minimal amount of effort. This blog chronicles my attempt to get things done, lazily.

I also use mostly Apple so you might get the occasional post about my opinions on their products.
