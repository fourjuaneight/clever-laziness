A bit of a heavy topic for a blog. I think we're in a simulation anywayâ€¦ So I have some things to do, and there are rather clever ways to get through it with little effort. With the help of automation, a bit of code and some creative thinking we can leverage the power of technology and the web to get things done.

The blog is about automation. And productivity. In case you didn't get it. Ok.
