  <p>I'm Juan and I make websites for a living. This site serves two purposes: a testing ground for new web technologies I'm learning and a place to share how try to automate stuff in my life. I might share something other stuff. There's a bookshelf in case you're interested. But if I'm completely honest, there's usually too much stuff in my head and I need a place to offload all of that so it doesn't keep me up at night. So I guess that's really what this site is for.</p>
  <p>Anyways, subscribe to the feeds:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>{{< link href="/articles/feed.json" content="Articles" >}}</li>
    <li>{{< link href="/bookshelf/feed.json" content="Bookshelf" >}}</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Yes, I know they're JSON. Yes, they should work on your RSS reader.</p>
