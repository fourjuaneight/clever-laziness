The amount of work I'm able to accomplish on any given day depends on how much effort I have to put into it. It’s evident I won’t get very far in life being this lazy, so a while ago I started to come up with clever ways to get a lot done with the minimal amount of effort. This blog chronicles my attempt to get things done — lazily — with the help of automation, a bit of code and some creative thinking.
