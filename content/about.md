I'm Juan and I make websites for a living. This site serves two purposes: a testing ground for new web technologies I'm learning and a place to share how try to automate stuff in my life. I might share something other stuff. There's a bookshelf in case you're interested. Anyhow, ideally you'll see the quality of the site improve and the source code constantly evolve. Fair warning, I'm a shitty writer so don't expect much from the content.
