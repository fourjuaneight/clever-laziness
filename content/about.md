Procrastination (noun) - he action of delaying or postponing something:*your first tip is to avoid procrastination*. That's nice. But I have shit that needs to get done, and there are rather clever ways to get through it with little effort. With some automation, a bit of code and a little of creative thinking, we can leverage the power of the web and computers to get shit done, lazily.
