A bit of a heavy topic for a blog. I think we're in a simulation anywayâ€¦ So I have some things to do, and there are rather clever ways to get through it with little effort. With the help of automation, a bit of code and some creative thinking we can leverage the power of technology and the web to get things done.

This is a microblog about automation. And productivity. In case you didn't get it. Ok.
