The end of civilization will come, not by climate change or nuclear war, but by millions of connected microwaves and coffee makers becoming sentient at once! So while we wait for that day, let's leverage the power of the web and machines to make them work for us.

Made [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) do it, threw it on [GitHub](https://github.com) and had [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) pass it around. Have questions or suggestions? Hit me up on Twitter. You can also subscribe to my RSS feed, if you're into that sort of stuff.
