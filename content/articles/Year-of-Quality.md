Every year, the guys over at {{< link href="https://www.relay.fm/cortex" content="Cortex" >}} come up with a theme that sets an overarching idea that guides their decisions. There has been the "Year or Less" and "Year of Positivity" since 2017. Some people have began to follow along their own yearly themes, like {{< link href="https://twitter.com/aspiringrobotfm/status/1076594940304601089" content="Quinn Rose" >}} with her "Year of Quality".

That got me thinking of some recent changes I've made lately. There's only so much one can consume and yet there's a vast amount of good content out there. I typically have a backlog of at least a dozen podcast episodes and more YouTube videos. Not to mention the several shows we watch at home, the 50 or so articles on my Reading List and several audiobooks I'd like to get through. So yeah, a ton of stuff. And although I do enjoy all these things and go through them eventually, I can't recall what most of them were or if I gain anything valuable from them. Now, I don't want to be a snob about it, but I do value my time and time I can do much better. And that was my thinking when I began cutting back on the media I consumed and how I spent my time. I slowly started doing this a few months ago and this is what I've done so far and what I plan to do next.

## The Cleanse
First and foremost, the mayoirty of the stuff and see or listen to tends to be science or tech related. There's no "I want to better myself" motive behind it, I just genuiely find it fascinating and enjoyable. But there's a lot of the same displayed in different ways. So I figured I'd classify the content based on impact; whether the content make an impressing to the point that I'd go back to it or even wrote down some of it. Here's how I went about it with each category.

### Podcasts
My player of choice is Overcast. And although Overcast doesn't have a starred list, it is relatively easy to view your stars on the episodes list. This was the easiest way to go about figuring out which shows make a regular impact. There's 3 main genres I listen to: Comedy, Science, and Tech. Comedy is only 3 shows, and Tech about the same. I mean Tech podcasts are a dime a dozen and tend to cover practically the same topics. So I kept those that talked about more niche and specific topics. And though Science had a ton of different shows, I was about to use the same strategy as with Tech and slim down the playlists. To give you an idea of what I mean, Tech has shows like {{< link href="https://engineered.network/pragmatic/" content="Pragmatic" >}} and {{< link href="http://atp.fm/" content="ATP" >}}, while Science has {{< link href="https://www.20k.org/" content="Twenty Thousand Hertz" >}} and {{< link href="http://radio.seti.org/" content="Big Picture Science" >}}.

There's also Development, which is sorta like tech where many of the shows cover the same topics, but it's also a little harder because there aren't that many that cover very specific topics. So I went with 3 great ones. One covers general front-end stuff, the other has more JavaScript related topics, and the last does a deep dive on the history of the Computer Science and the people that made it what it is now. It's called {{< link href="https://www.redhat.com/en/command-line-heroes" content="Command Line Heros" >}} and you should check it out if you're into that sort of stuff.

### Videos
Almost all of the videos/shows I view are from either YouTube of Netflix. There's one or two shows I might have to "rent" elsewhere to watch it, but that's rare. This doesn't take into account movies, as we often go to the theaters and buy copies of the ones we like to rewatch often. So it's mostly shows.

There's exactly 9 shows we watch in my household. It used to be much more, but stopped for one (or both) of two reasons. Either it required paying a subscription for just that show or renting through iTunes. Game of Thrones is always the exception, but for the most part, no show is worth $15 a month. I guess that's why piracy is going up. Or the plot just got boring. So cleaning house here was quite easy to be honest. There's a lot of quality TV now and there's no need to waste it on stuff that just OK.

With YouTube it's a little different. There's a lot of great creators I enjoy and love their work, but there's simply too much. So I opted for using the same approach as with podcasts. So I looked at my watch history on each subscription, looked at my bookmarked videos, and considered the quality of the content in their respective genrese. With that, about 30 subscriptions become less than 20.

### Articles
I still use RSS and will continue to support it until it really dies, which I doubt (and hope) it ever will. But there's still a backlog of 46 articles I haven't even seen, plus about 10 in my Reading List half read. With this, it was a little harder than I thought. Many of the blogs I follow I've done so for years. But post very infrequently if not hardly at all. So those I let go. Then there's those that always have interesting content, but if I'm honest with myself, the title is what caught my attention I have no idea if I'll ever get to them so I just have to let it go. And lastly, there are the dozens of webcomics I follow which never miss. But, I followed the podcast approach. How often do I bookmark them, but also how often do I share them. So almost 30 became 9. And just like that, my feeds were slimmed down to only quality blogs that I never miss and always want to read from start to finish.

### Books
This was a little different. I don't read physical or ebooks; I really only listen to them. I really got into Audible halfway through 2018 and I almost always reserve a few hours before bed to listen to them. I always finished one book before jumping to another. And I tend to pick my books carefully. So with this, it was mostly setting more time aside to listen to them and enjoy the time a lot more. I found that cleaning and commuting are fantastic times to listen to them. And I got my partner into them as well so have an incentive to share my thoughts.

### Social
This was by far the easiest. I have a close knit group of friends and we're all antisocial nerds that never leave the house. So it works. Social meadia, well, I don't like sharing my personal life online so I don't do Facebook or Instagram. Also, I'm not about to start trusting Evil Corp after the year they've had. My Twitter feed is heavily filted with Tweetbot and I've unfollowed a ton of people that only post to complain. Reddit is, well Reddit. And I follow few subs there, but the ones I do are simply there for one purpose: releave me of my stress. So I really only open the app when I feel I need it.

## So Why the Cleanse?
I want to focus my time on better things this year. I don't know what exactly. I know I want to learn Nodejs and improve my Python. I also want to grow and improve as a developer. But I don't have set goals. Coming up with unrealistic goals that maybe I could never live up to is setting myself up for failure. I got into the development because I wanted to do a job I enjoyed. And I want to do the same with everything else. Forcing myself to accomplish a set goal during a period time quickly becomes more about completing it rather than want I get out of it. So instead, I'm going to follow on Quinn's idea and set the theme for a Year of Quality. Claning out my media consumption began as simply a time managment thing. There was too much, not enough time, and even less for other important stuff. But now, I consume only the best of each, and have time to do focus on other quality stuff.

### Coding
I want to transition from what I do now (front-end development) to Nodejs. I've gotten to play around with it and make some apps that I use frequently on my daily workflow and have really enjoyed it. So I want to continue doing it. This is also means I need to improve my JavaScript, which I've been working on more and more lately. And since it's the year of **quality**, I want to focus on writing quality JS.

### Writting
Even though I suck at writting, I want to do it more. For me, it's so much that I want to share my ideas, but rather getting the ideas out of my head. I often suffer from insomnia and it's mostly triggered by a restless mind. Writting things done gets all of that out of my head and helps we relax more. I used to keep a daily journal for that purpose alone, but that quickly started to feel like a chore. So I want to revive this blog and focus on writting some of the ideas and thoughts that really stick and get them out. And if someone finds them interesting, then awesome.

### Family
My family consists of me and my partner. We both work full time and spend all our free time together. But recently things have taken a turn. I enjoy what I do while my partner really doesn't. We've been talking about both doing development for quite some time, so I think this is the year we should really make that happen. If there's anything remotely close to a goal for this year is getting my partner into development and working from home with me.

## Commitment
When I first thought about doing this I was hesitant. I'm not particularly bad at commitment; I wouldn't have a job as a freelancer if I did. But I tend to lose interest in things over time. Like anyone I guess. Importance is relevant; what might be critical today can just as likely be nothing tomorrow. Priorities change, quickly. But that's precisely why I think a yearly theme will work. It's not meant to tie me into a set of tasks I need to accomplish within the year, but rather serve as a guide for my decission thorughout. So here's to hoping for a quality year.
