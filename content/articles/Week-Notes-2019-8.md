I'll be honest, this really wasn't a productive week at all. I decided to take the week off and focus on some personal development of sorts. There's a backlog of articles, podcasts, shows, and other more family-related tasks that I've been wanting to complete haven't really found the time to do so. And instead of putting things off I figured I'd just go for it and dedicate a week to it. I also planned on spending more time with my wife since we've had some busy few weeks and little time to ourselves.

## Health
After going back and forth about it for months, we finally decided to buy Apple Watches in an effort to improve our health and exercise more. I was already tracking my steps and calorie intake with {{< link href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pedometer/id712286167?mt=8" content="Pedometer++" >}} and {{< link href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lifesum-diet-macro-tracker/id286906691?mt=8" content="Lifesum" >}}. If I'm honest, the whole calorie tracking thing seems a bit too much for me, but I trying to get some meaningful use out of the data by setting goals and limits for myself. I do well when there's a goal to be met and setting maximum calorie/fat/sugar triggers this thing in my brain where I go insane if I don't meet that goal. It's very much a psychological thing for me but it works very well. So well, in fact, that simply having the Activity rings on my Apple Watch has gotten me to walk and run again every day. I know it's only been a week, but 6 days in a row is a first for me. I guess gamification does work.

Following with the fitness and health tracking, I downloaded {{< link href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/autosleep-tracker-for-watch/id1164801111?mt=8" content="AutoSleep" >}} and began tracking my sleep. I won't say I suffer from insomnia because that would just be an insult to people who actually suffer from it. No, my problem is that I have the mind of a 5-year-old and can't shut down at the end of the day. Anything of remote interest that pops into my head while trying to sleep needs my full attention and I can't help myself. I already have most notifications off on my phone by default and Do Not Disturb is on during 12 hours of the day. So there are almost no notifications on my phone can distract me. It's not even social media that's a problem. I simply can't relax my brain enough to fall asleep. But having some nice "rings" to complete every night and a little of Melatonin seems to be doing the trick. The first few days were still hard; this wasn't like an instant miracle where I put on the Watch and my life changed. But I did completely changes my night habits and work with the Watch to sort of force myself to relax. Here's what worked for me:
- Place the phone far away from the bed. I'm too lazy to get up and look for it so this works fine.
- Write anything and everything that's in my head at the end of the day. I've been journaling for a while now in an effort to get things out of my head at night, so this is just continuing with the routine.
- Put on some relaxing music on the HomePod. Relaxing is very relative, and what work's for me seems to be the Interstellar soundtrack.
- Take some Melatonin 30ms before bed.

Having the data from AutoSleep is key here since I was able to test what worked best for me. The data tells me how quickly I fall to sleep and if I'm restless at night. I noticed the music and taking the pill 30 minutes prior instead right before helped a ton. The journal is part of the process. Moving the phone whoever was tricky. I mean, not *really*; it's just moving it elsewhere. But I was afraid that not having somewhere to write down what was in my head right away or put in a reminder for the next day might make things worse. I thought things would just stay in my head and keep me up until I physically got up and grabbed the phone. But no. I think having the phone next to me was inducing me into overanalyzing things just because I knew I had it next to me. Now I just ignore it and input any reminders on Things quickly on the Watch. There's not much I can do on the Watch so I just take care of business and get back to sleep. The pills seem to be helping get to sleep, which is what I wanted. I didn't want sleeping pills (too paranoid; what if my wife chokes and needs me or there's a bomb), so this was the best alternative. All natural and simply works as an aid{{< fn 1 >}}. Of course, it's only been a week so let's see how things progress after next week.

## Code
There's wasn't much in this front since it was my "week off". But I did take some time to work on this site. I've been meaning to learn {{< link href="https://webpack.js.org" content="Webpack" >}} since that's what the rest of the industry is using. I've used {{< link href="https://gulpjs.com" content="Gulp" >}} of asset optimization, Sass compile and critical CSS inlining for some time now. I work primarily with {{< link href="https://gohugo.io" content="Hugo" >}}, which has native JS bundling and Sass to CSS support. And this has worked perfectly for me so far. But I wanted to up my game a learn something new. So I figured I'd just jump right into it and migrate my workflow. Best way to learn is to just get slapped in the face with it{{< fn 2 >}}.

I'm still having some trouble using {{< link href="https://babeljs.io" content="Babel" >}}, but I was able to easily migrate my image optimization, Sass, and inlined critical CSS workflows. I've tried using Webpack in the past but couldn't figure it out. For some reason this time around it clicked quite easily. I guess one does get better over time.

## Digest
There was a lot I consumed this week, but I want to highlight some of my favorite stuff.

## Listen
I finally started listening to {{< link href="https://hellofromthemagictavern.com" content="Hello From The Magic Tavern" >}}. It's great{{< fn 3 >}}. I'm a big fan of {{< link href="https://www.maximumfun.org/shows/adventure-zone" content="The Adventure Zone" >}} from the {{< link href="https://www.themcelroy.family" content="McElroy" >}} bros and have been looking for another good adventure type podcast. I'm already up to episode 60 in just a week and have already bookmarked a few episodes. If you're into this sort of things, definitely check it out.

## Watch
Last year, I came across a blacksmith YouTuber by the name of {{< link href="https://youtube.com/user/alectheblacksmith" content="Alec Steele" >}}. He does some amazing work, primarily swords. The production value is pretty good, but that's not what got me hooked. Alec is relatively young but has an amazing work ethic. He's always pushing his limits and learning new things outside of his comfort zone for his videos. And like any of us, he fails a lot. But he always looks at things as a learning opportunity and seems to enjoy the adventure. I know there's some level of "acting" for the video, but it seems very genuine to me. It's gotten me to look at how I handle new things at work and my view on them.

## Read
I recently finished {{< link href="https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Three-Body-Problem-Audiobook/B00P0277C2" content="The Three-Body Problem" >}} by Liu Cixin. I actually listened to it via Audible, but it still counts. The book was great and I personally enjoyed the heavy science in it. But this week I started the second installment in the series, {{< link href="https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Dark-Forest-Audiobook/B010PKSKBA" content="The Dark Forest" >}}, and I'm having a really tough time with it. I like the story and there's nothing particular about it that I dislike. My problem is, they changed the narrator of the audiobook and it's driving me nuts. I was so accustomed to the characters' "voices" with the previous narrator and with this new one, it just feels off. I might just end up having to read it via Kindle if I can't get used to it.

Whoa, I sound awful complaining about this. Such a 1st world problem. Here's something more interesting.

I came across this old article from 2009{{< fn 4 >}} on {{< link href="https://www.wired.com/2009/11/ff-vanish2/" content="Wired" >}} that details how {{< link href="https://magazine.atavist.com/author/evan" content="Evan Ratliff" >}} tried to vanish completely and the great effort that took in a digital age. This is 2009 when the iPhone was a mere two years old and our digital lives were starting to take shape into what they are now where it's nearly impossible to vanish. In the article, he chronicles his process and efforts from start to finish and everything he went through to make it happen. There's a lot more to this, including how it became a social media hunt and people actively looking for him everywhere. It's a great read and there are some follow-up articles covering different aspects of the ordeal.
