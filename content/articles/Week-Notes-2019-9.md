Coming back from a week off, I didn't have much to do. So I figured I'd start working on one of the courses I've been meaning to take. My web development work has been primarily with Hugo and Jekyll in the last couple years. But as React has grown, so has {{< link href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/" content="Gatsby" >}} and the amount of clients I get asking me if it's a better alternative. Unfourtunately, I've been unable to provide an educated opinion since I don't know Gatsby. So I figured it was time to learn how the tech works and maybe use it with my work.

## Code
- {{< link href="https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/pro-gatsby-2" content="LevelUp Tutorials Pro Gatsby 2 Course" >}}

I'm a fan of the {{< link href="" content="Syntax podcast" >}}. Wes and Scott always have some very interesting and relatable topics that have serve me well as a freelancer over the last couple years. I've taken some of Wes' courses, but this is the first time I take one of Scott's with LevelUp Tutorials. I saw a couple of the videos that are free on YouTube and it seems exactly what I was looking for; a quick and dirty deep dive into Gatsby for developers that are familiar with most front-end concepts. If Gatsby is something you've been wanted to learn and don't want a course that starts from the very bottom, this is for you.

## Digest
A lot of the media I went through this week was somewhat of a downer. But to be honest, that seems to be the stuff I mostly tend to like. However, the stuff I'll share this week help we evaluate a lot of my social media habits and how I can improve them a bit. The key word here is improve. I'm not looking to use social media less or leave it altogether. I've tried that many times to no avail and I'm come to the realization that the product itself is not my problem, but rather the way I use it and the stuff I consume there. So instead of fighting against the current, I'd use it to my advantage.

### Listen
- {{< link href="https://overcast.fm/+Jh7_XKV6E" content="How To Fix Social Media" >}}

The journalists over at Radio Atalntic discussed how they've attempted to "fix" social media in general, but also for themselves from two different perspectives. Alexis has tried to mitigate content outside of his chosen accounts by removing retweets and tweets, really. He uses {{< link href="https://nuzzel.com/" content="Nuzzle" >}} to only see articles posted and the conversations around those tweets. Matt, on the other hand, chose to engage more with his followers and have them raiio him. He's asked people to reply directly to anything he tweets and have a conversation about it, rather than simply like or retweet. Both have found the platform to be more enjoyable for them this way.

It's fascinating how much we have to work on making Twitter an enjoyable place for us since the "stock" version of the platform isn't all that pleasant to most. For me personally, turning off retweets, adding many phrases to filters/mutes, turning off notifications, and using a 3rd party client for true chronological order has been what works. I creates a feed for only the stuff I want to see and nothing more. I'm well aware I'm creating a silo for myself, but my use of Twitter is closer to that of an RSS reader. But why don't you just use an RSS reader then, you might ask. Because I want to read the conversations around the articles I want. And I know there are tools out there for this specific purpose, but I like my method, and it's also free.

20k Hertz always has some wonderful content. This episode focused on silence and how hard it is to find it today with the amount of stuff happening around us at every moment. So much sound can become a destructive interference when we try to concentrate on a task. The host is locked inside an anechoic chamber during the episode and narrats some of the exprienice. He found it to be quite soothing.

I often work in "silence". But it's really all that silent. My keyboard is loud, there's an airport nearby, the neighbors dogs barks a lot, and so on. But still, the little silence I do get is relaxing. I can think more clearly and find that I get a sense of freedom to expand my thoughts in a way and think bigger and louder. I'm not sure how much sense that makes, but it's something I've learned to enjoy more lately.

### Watch
- {{< link href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KVI-blFfDWc" content="A Floridian's Guide to Living Someplace Very Very Cold" >}}

I'm from Florida. My hometown is a small area in central east Florida. It rains a lot, it's mostly dry and warm throughout the year, and there's plenty of days with clear blue skies. During my ealy teens, we moved to Virginia, where I've lived for over a decade now. The change in climat was obviously harsh, but there's a lot of little details that no one really tells you about when you move from a warm place to a cold one. Hank to does a fantstic job explaining this to you. So if you're planning on doing a move like this soon, this video let you know the stuff no one seems to ever tell you.

Kurzgesagt puts out educational videos with amazing animatinos almost every week. They focus on mostly scietific topics and do their best to provide the most accurate informate to date and form a healthy discussion around a topic. But in a time of so much disinformation, it's hard to trust a pretty video online. So the team behind the channel put together a video on their investigatino process and how the information is fact checked for the best possible accuracy. They as talk about the videos they consider to be somewhat "failures" and why that is.

Whether you're looking for an informed reason to trust them or how to verify the information you see elsewhere online, this video can serve as a guide on how to do so. But I feel it can also help anyone looking to make educational content.

This was a great article with some disturbing content; so I'll make this quick.

Facebook is a terrible company that is deeply entrenched in your digital lives. That's my opinion and you're free to criticize it. However, a lot of what makes Facebook bad is the content on platform and not just the company itself. They are heavily critizide for their bad moderation, but it's a huge challenge to filter the content of 1.74 billion users. They have a lot of computational power going into this, but a lot of it is done by people. These people have to submit themselves to the viel things that are frequently uploaded to the platform. And it's a lot of terrible stuff they have to see. They go through the trauma so we don't have to. This article covers some of the people in one of the contractors for Facebook moderation and the effects this content has on them.

This is an old story which I came across on the Wire print maganize. I vague remember glancing over it. But then I found it again online a few days ago and found it fascinating. There's an underground society that focuses on the restoration and preservation of art and history in France. And they literaly work underground in the catacombs of Paris. They done a number of stuff in the past like restoring the Pantheon's 19th-century clock and running film festivals in the tunnels. It's very interesting stuff.

I played so many hours of the original Red Dead game and which I had the time to play the new one. I find myself mostly watching playthroughs and live streams these days. So this read about a player and his massive horse on the online version of the game was a treat.
